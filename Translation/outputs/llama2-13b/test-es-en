In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were feathered, a theory that is already widespread, it also offers specific data that fossils usually do not offer, such as their color and their three-dimensional structure.
According to the experts, this animal has a chestnut-colored plumage in the upper part and a pale or carotenoid tone in the lower part.
Also, the discovery allows us to understand better the evolution of the feathers of the birds.
Since the plumage of the dinosaurs does not have a well-developed axis, called rachis, but does present other features of the feathers (barbs and barbules), the researchers concluded that it is likely that the rachis is the result of a later evolutionary development of these other characteristics.
The structure that presents the plumage suggests that its function was not related to flight, but that they used them to regulate temperature or as an indicator of the same. The researchers maintain that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample analyzed presents features of the plumage of an adult and not of a chick.
The experts' assessments were that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen illustrates more the plumage of an adult than that of a chick.
