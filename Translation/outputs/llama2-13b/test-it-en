"We have four-month-old mice that were diabetic and now aren't anymore", he added.
The study is still in its early stages, as cautiously stated by Dr. Ehud Ur, professor of medicine at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and director of the clinical and scientific department of the Canadian Diabetes Association.
Like other experts, he is skeptical about the possibility of curing diabetes, emphasizing that these results have no relevance for those who are already affected by type 1 diabetes.

In the past, Jamie Siminoff, CEO of Ring, has highlighted that the company was born when he could not hear the doorbell from his garage shop.
He said he had built a Wi-Fi doorbell.
Siminoff has declared that sales are increased after his appearance in 2013 in an episode of Shark Tank, in which the jury of the program has refused to finance the startup.
Siminoff appeared on the commercial television station QVC at the end of 2017.
Ring has also reached a transactive agreement with the competing security services company, the ADT Corporation.
On the one hand, it seems that there is an experimental vaccine capable of reducing mortality from Ebola, but on the other hand, no drug has yet been found that has clearly proven to be suitable for the treatment of the existing infection.
A cocktail of antibodies, ZMapp, has initially shown promising results in the field, but formal studies have revealed a lower efficacy than that hoped for in the prevention of deaths.
In the PALM studio, ZMapp was used as a control, i.e. the scientists used it as a reference and compared it with the other three therapies.
The USA Gymnastics supports the letter of the United States Olympic Committee and recognizes the absolute necessity from the Olympic community to work to create a safe environment for all its athletes.
We agree with what was said by the USOC, namely that the interests of our athletes and our clubs, and of their sport, can be better served by bringing about a significant change within our organization, and not with decertification.
The USA Gymnastics has promoted an independent investigation to understand how it was possible that an abuse of the dimensions described with such courage by those who have been able to survive Larry Nassar remained hidden for so long, and is willing to implement any necessary or appropriate change.
USA Gymnastics and USOC have the same goal: to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible, so that athletes can pursue their dreams in an environment that is reliable, positive and responsible.

This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely disseminated, but provides more details than the fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was brownish-chestnut in the upper part, with a pale or carotenoid coloration in the lower part.
The discovery also allows us to obtain detailed information about the evolution of the feathers of birds.
Because the plumage of the dinosaur is not equipped with the basic structure, the so-called rachis, but has other characteristics typical of feathers, barbs and barbules, the researchers have concluded that the rachis is probably the result of a subsequent evolutionary development of these characteristics.
The structure of the plumage makes you think that it was not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or courtship. Researchers hypothesize that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows an adult plumage and not the down of a chick.
According to the hypotheses of the researchers, although the tail belongs to a young dinosaur, the sample reveals a plumage of an adult specimen and not that of a chick.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning in the headquarters of the police in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two agents and injuring more than twenty people.
The governor's office has reported that among the injured, nineteen were police officers.
The police have reported that the suspect responsible for the attack is a presumed militant of Daesh (ISIL).
They have discovered that the functioning of the Sun is based on the same principles as the other stars: the activity of all the stars in the solar system is determined by nothing other than their luminosity and rotation.
The luminosity is used together with the rotation to define the number of Rossby of a star, which is related to the flow of plasma.
The more the Rossby number is low, the lesser is the activity of the star compared to the magnetic inversions.
During his trip, Iwasaki has gotten into trouble on several occasions.

The standard 802.11n can operate both in the 2.4Ghz band and in the 5.0Ghz band.
Place that the base station has double radio, this will allow it to be backward compatible with 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g.
The 802.11n speeds are considerably higher than those of the previous versions, with a maximum theoretical throughput of 600 Mbps.

"We will strive to cut carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by a significant margin by 2020, compared to the levels of 2005," Hu said.
He has not established a precise value of the reduction, stating that it will depend on the economic productivity of China.
He has invited the developing countries to "avoid the old way of polluting first and cleaning up later".
He also added that they should not, however, be forced to take on obligations that go beyond their stage of development, as well as their responsibilities and competences.
