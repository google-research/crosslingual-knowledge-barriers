While an experimental vaccine appears to be able to reduce the mortality of Ebola, there are currently no medicines that have been proven to be effective in treating existing infections.
A cocktail of antibodies, ZMapp, initially seemed promising, but formal studies showed that it, in terms of preventing deaths, had fewer advantages than expected.
In the PALM-Study, ZMapp was used as a control, i.e. the scientists used it as a baseline and compared the three other treatments with it.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter of the U.S. Olympic Committee and accepts it as an absolute necessity that the Olympic family advocates for a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the statement of the USOC that the interests of our athletes and clubs and their sport are better served if we within our organization promote sensible changes, rather than decertification.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that could bring to light how abuse in the magnitude described by survivors of Larry Nassar was able to go undetected for so long, and welcomes all necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC have the same goal - to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible for athletes so they can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive and self-determined environment.

This confirms not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but also provides details that fossils in general cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal on the upper side was chestnut-brown and on the underside was light or carotinoid-colored.
The find also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called the rachis, but other features of feathers – spines and barbules – the researchers concluded that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or to show off. The researchers suspected that the specimen, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, shows the plumage of an adult and not the down of a chick.
The researchers claimed that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the plumage of an adult and not downy feathers.

You have found out that the sun works on the same principles as other stars: It was found out that the activity of all stars in the system is driven by their luminosity, rotation and nothing else.
To determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flow, the luminosity and the rotation are taken into account together.
The smaller the Rossby number is, the less active the star is in terms of flipping the magnetic field.

The 802.11n standard runs on the frequencies 2,4 Ghz and 5,0 Ghz.
It can be backward-compatible with 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g, provided that the base station has Dual-Radio.
The speed of 802.11 n is significantly faster than that of its predecessors, which had a maximum theoretical throughput of 600 Mbit/s.
