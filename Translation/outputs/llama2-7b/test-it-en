"We have rats of four months that before were diabetic and now they are not anymore", he added.
The study is still in its initial phase, as stated cautiously by Dr. Ehud Ur, professor of medicine at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and director of the clinical and scientific department of the Canadian Diabetes Association.
Like other experts, he is skeptical about the possibility of curing diabetes, emphasizing that these results do not have relevance for those who are already affected by type 1 diabetes.

Previously, Jamie Siminoff, CEO of Ring, has emphasized that the company was born when it was still not possible to hear the doorbell from his garage store.
He said he had built a Wi-Fi bell.

Siminoff appeared on the commercial television station QVC at the end of 2017.
Ring ha inoltre raggiunto un accordo transattivo con la società concorrente di servizi di sicurezza, la ADT Corporation.
On the one hand, it seems that there is an experimental vaccine that can reduce mortality from Ebola, on the other hand, no drug has yet been found that has clearly been shown to be effective in treating the existing infection.
A cocktail of antibodies, ZMapp, initially showed promise in the field, but formal studies have revealed lower efficacy than expected in the prevention of deaths.
In the PALM study, ZMapp was used as a control, i.e. the scientists used it as a reference and compared it with the other three therapies.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the U.S. Olympic Committee and recognizes the absolute necessity for the Olympic community to work together to create a safe environment for all of its athletes.
We agree with what is stated by the USOC, namely that the interests of our athletes and our clubs, and their sport, can be better served by bringing about a significant change within our organization, and not by decertification.
The USA Gymnastics has promoted an independent investigation to understand how it was possible that an abuse of the dimensions described with so much courage by those who managed to survive Larry Nassar could have been hidden for so long, and is willing to implement any necessary or appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and USOC have the same goal: to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible, so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive and responsible environment.

This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely disseminated, but also provides more details than the fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
. According to what scientists say, the plumage of this animal was brownish-red in the upper part, with a pale or carotene-like coloration in the lower part.
The discovery also allows you to obtain detailed information about the evolution of the feathers of birds.
Because the plumage of the dinosaur is not equipped with the basic structure, the so-called rachis, but has instead other characteristics typical of feathers, barbs and barbules, the researchers have concluded that the rachis is probably the result of an evolutionary development subsequent to such characteristics.
The structure of the plumage suggests that it was not used for flight, but rather for thermoregulation or courtship. The researchers hypothesize that, although it is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and not juvenile plumage.
Secondo le ipotesi dei ricercatori, nonostante la coda appartenga a un giovane dinosauro, il campione rivela un piumaggio da esemplare adulto e non quello di un pulcino.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning in the headquarters of the police in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two policemen and injuring more than 20 people.
The office of the governor has reported that among the injured, nineteen were police officers.
The police have reported that the suspect responsible for the attack is a presumed militant of Daesh (ISIL).
They have discovered that the functioning of the Sun is based on the same basic principles as the other stars: the activity of all the stars in the solar system is determined only by their luminosity and rotation.
The luminosity is used together with the rotation to define the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the lower the activity of the star with respect to the magnetic inversions.

The 802.11n standard can operate in both the 2.4Ghz and 5.0Ghz bands.
A place where the base station has double radios, this will allow it to be backward compatible with 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g.
The 802.11n speeds are considerably higher than those of the previous versions, with a maximum theoretical throughput of 600 Mbps.

"We will strive to cut carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by a significant margin by 2020, compared with the level in 2005", said Hu.
He has not set a precise value for the reduction, saying that it will depend on the economic productivity of China.
He has invited the developing countries to "avoid the old way of polluting first and then cleaning up".
He also added that they should not, in any case, be forced to assume obligations that go beyond their phase of development, as well as their responsibilities and competences.
