USA Gymnastics supports the statement of the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee and recognizes that it is imperative that the Olympic and Paralympic family foster a safe environment for all of our athletes.

USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that can clarify how the abuse that the survivors of Larry Nassar described with such courage could have gone on for so long without being seen and accepts any necessary and appropriate changes.
The goal of USA Gymnastics and USOC is the same: to ensure that gymnastics and other sports are as safe as possible for athletes to pursue their dreams in a protected, positive and enhanced environment.

In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were feathered, the theory also offers specific data that fossils generally do not offer, such as their color and their three-dimensional structure.
According to the experts, this animal has a brown plumage on the upper part and a pale or carotinoid tonality on the lower part.
In addition, the discovery allows us to better understand the evolution of the feathers of birds.
Given that the plumage of dinosaurs does not have a well-developed rachis, but rather presents other features of feathers (bristles and barbs), the researchers came to the conclusion that it is likely that the rachis is the result of a subsequent evolutionary development of these other characteristics.
The structure that presents the plumage suggests that its function was not related to the flight, but that they were used to regulate the temperature or as an indicator of the same. The researchers maintain that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample analyzed presents features of the plumage of an adult and not of a chick.
The opinions of the experts were that, even though it is the tail of a short-lived dinosaur, the specimen illustrates more the plumage of an adult than that of a juvenile.

The intensity of the light and the rotation are combined to calculate the Rossby number of a star, linked to the flow of plasma.
The smaller the number of Rossby, the smaller the activity of the star in relation to its magnetic inversions.

The 802.11n standard works on both 2.4Ghz and 5.0Ghz frequencies.
This will make possible its compatibility with previous versions of 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g, insofar as the base station has dual radios.
The speeds of the 802.11n standard are much higher than those achieved by those that preceded it, with a theoretical maximum of 600 Mbps.
