"We have four-month-old mice that were diabetic before and are not anymore," she added.
The study is still in its early stages, as cautiously stated by Dr. Ehud Ur, a professor of medicine at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and director of the clinical and scientific department of the Canadian Diabetes Association.
Like other experts, he is skeptical about the possibility of curing diabetes, emphasizing that these results are not relevant for those who already have type 1 diabetes.
The permanent secretary of the Nobel Committee for Literature of the Swedish Academy, Sara Danius, during a radio program aired on Monday on the Swedish radio Sveriges Radio, publicly announced that the Committee had given up on contacting Bob Dylan, failing to reach him directly to inform him of the Nobel Prize for Literature 2016

Previously, Jamie Siminoff, CEO of Ring, emphasized that the company was born when he still couldn't hear the doorbell from his garage shop.
He said he built a Wi-Fi doorbell.
Siminoff stated that sales increased after his appearance in 2013 on an episode of Shark Tank, where the program's panel refused to finance the startup.
Siminoff appeared on the commercial television channel QVC at the end of 2017.
Ring has also reached a settlement agreement with the competitor security services company, ADT Corporation.
On one hand, it seems that there is an experimental vaccine capable of reducing mortality from Ebola, but on the other hand, no drug has been found yet that has clearly proven to be suitable for treating the existing infection.
A cocktail of antibodies, ZMapp, initially showed promise in the field, but formal studies revealed a lower effectiveness than hoped for in preventing deaths.
In the PALM study, ZMapp was used as a control measure, meaning that scientists used it as a reference and compared it with the other three therapies.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and recognizes the absolute necessity for the Olympic community to work towards creating a safe environment for all its athletes.
We agree with what the USOC stated, namely that the interests of our athletes and our clubs, and of their sport, can be better served by moving forward with a significant change within our organization, rather than through decertification.
USA Gymnastics has promoted an independent investigation to understand how it was possible that an abuse of the dimensions described with such courage by those who managed to survive Larry Nassar remained hidden for so long, and is willing to implement any necessary or appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and USOC have the same goal: to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible, so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a reliable, positive, and accountable environment.

The announcement was made following a phone call between Trump and the Turkish president Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan.
Turkey, says the statement, would also take over the custody of ISIS fighters imprisoned, who have not been repatriated due to the refusal of European nations.
This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely spread, but also provides more details than the fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was brown chestnut on the upper part, with a pale or carotenoid coloring on the lower part.
The discovery also allows to obtain detailed information about the evolution of birds' feathers.
Since the dinosaur's plumage is not equipped with the basic structure, the so-called rachis, but instead has other characteristics typical of feathers, such as barbs and barbules, researchers have concluded that the rachis is probably the result of an evolutionary development subsequent to these characteristics.
The structure of the plumage suggests that it was not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or courtship. Researchers hypothesize that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and not down feathers typical of a chick.
According to the researchers' hypotheses, despite the tail belonging to a young dinosaur, the sample reveals feathering typical of an adult specimen and not that of a chick.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two officers and injuring over twenty people.
The governor's office reported that among the injured, nineteen were police officers.
The police reported that the suspected perpetrator of the attack is an alleged militant of Daesh (ISIL).
They discovered that the operation of the Sun is based on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the solar system is determined solely by their brightness and rotation.
Luminosity is used together with rotation to define the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the lower the star's activity compared to magnetic inversions.
During his trip, Iwasaki got into trouble on several occasions.
He was robbed by pirates, attacked by a rabid dog in Tibet, escaped a marriage in Nepal, and was arrested in India.
The 802.11n standard can operate in both the 2.4GHz and 5.0GHz bands.
Assuming the base station has dual radios, this will allow it to be backward compatible with 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g.
802.11n speeds are considerably higher compared to those of previous versions, with a maximum theoretical throughput of 600 Mbps.
Duvall, married with two adult children, did not arouse much interest in Miller, to whom he told the story.
When asked for a comment, Miller replied: "Mike talks a lot during the hearing... I was getting ready so I wasn't listening to what he was saying."
"Hu stated that we will strive to cut carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by a significant margin by 2020, compared to 2005 levels."
He did not establish a precise value for the reduction, stating that it will depend on the Chinese economic productivity.
Hu invited developing countries to "avoid the old path of polluting first and cleaning up later."
He also added that they should not, however, be forced to take on obligations that go beyond their stage of development, as well as their responsibilities and competences.
