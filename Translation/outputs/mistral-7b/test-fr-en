« We now have 4-month-old mice that are no longer diabetic, even though they were previously », he added.
Dr. Ehud Ur, professor of medicine at Dalhousie University in Halifax (Nova Scotia) and president of the Clinical and Scientific Division of the Canadian Diabetes Association, has warned that research is still in its infancy.

Monday, on a radio show on Sveriges Radio, in Sweden, Sara Danius, permanent secretary of the Nobel Committee for Literature of the Swedish Academy, publicly announced that the committee, unable to directly contact Bob Dylan about the Nobel Prize in Literature 2016, had given up trying to contact him.

Previously, the CEO of Ring, Jamie Siminoff, noted that he launched the company when the doorbell of his front door was not audible from his store in his garage.
He says he has designed a Wi-Fi doorbell.
M. Siminoff said that sales increased after his appearance in 2013 in an episode of Shark Tank where the panel of the series refused to finance the start-up.
At the end of 2017, Siminoff appeared on the shopping channel QVC.
Ring has also settled a lawsuit with a competitor security company, the ADT Corporation.
Even if an experimental vaccine seems so far to be able to reduce the mortality rate of Ebola, no remedy has yet been sufficiently effective to treat the existing infection.
Even though the administration of a cocktail of antibodies, ZMapp, had initially shown promising signs in the field, formal studies have shown that its ability to limit deaths did not meet expectations.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp was used as a control, which means that the scientists used it as a reference and compared the three other treatments to it.
The American Gymnastics Federation supports the letter of the U.S. Olympic Committee and accepts the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the statement of the USOC (United States Olympic Committee) that the interests of our athletes and our clubs, as well as their sport, could be better served. This can be done by going forward and proceeding rather to significant changes within our organization, rather than revocation of accreditation.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that could shed light on the way in which the abuse described so courageously by the survivors of Larry Nassar was able to go unnoticed for so long and adopts all necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC have the same goal: to make gymnastics, as well as other sports, as safe as possible so that athletes can continue to pursue their dreams in a safe, positive and responsible environment.

The announcement was made after Mr. Trump had had a telephone conversation with the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
Turkey would also take charge of the guard of ISIS fighters captured that, according to the statement, European nations have refused to repatriate.
This confirms not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already very widespread, but provides details that the fossils can usually not provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
The scientists say that the plumage of this animal was brown chestnut on the top and pale or carotenoid on the bottom.
This discovery also allows us to better understand the evolution of feathers in birds.
Given that the feathers of dinosaurs do not have a fully developed shaft, which is called the rachis, but nevertheless show other characteristics typical of feathers – barbs and barbules – the researchers have deduced that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development of these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight but rather for the regulation or display of temperature. The researchers have suggested that, even if it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult plumage and not the down of a chick.
Scientists clarify that it is indeed the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, but the sample reveals a plumage belonging to an adult individual, and not to a young one.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, this morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 others.
The governor's office said that 19 of the wounded were police officers.

They observed that the Sun functioned according to the same basic principles as other stars. The activity of all the stars in the system is determined by their luminosity, their rotation and nothing else.
The luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flux.
In the case of magnetic inversions, the smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star.
During his journey, Iwasaki had problems on many occasions.
He was robbed by pirates, attacked by a rabid dog in Tibet, escaped a wedding in Nepal and was arrested in India.
The 802.11n standard works on both the 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz frequencies.
This will authorize retro-compatibility with 802.11a, b and g iterations, provided that the station has two radios.
The speeds of the Wi-Fi 802.11n standard are significantly faster than those of its predecessors, with a theoretical maximum speed of 600 Mbit/s.
Duvall, who is married and has two adult children, did not make a good impression on Miller, to whom the story was told.
When he was asked to comment, Miller said: "Mike talks a lot during the hearing... I was preparing, so I didn't really hear what he was saying."
"We will make a significant effort to reduce carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 2020 compared to 2005 levels," said Mr. Hu.
He hasn't encrypted these reductions, saying that they will be based on Chinese economic production.
He encouraged developing countries "to avoid the old method which consisted of polluting first and cleaning up later".
They should not be asked to assume obligations that exceed their stage of development, their responsibility and their capacities.
