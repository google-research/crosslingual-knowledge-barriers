Rings CEO Jamie Siminoff said once that he founded the company after he couldn't hear his garage doorbell from his garage workshop.
He said that he had built a WLAN doorbell.

While an experimental vaccine appears to be able to reduce Ebola mortality, so far there are no medicines that have been proven to be suitable for the treatment of existing infections.
An antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially appeared promising, formal studies showed, however, that it, in terms of preventing deaths, brought fewer benefits than hoped.
In the PALM study, ZMapp was used as a control, i.e. the scientists used it as a starting point and compared the three other treatments with it.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter of the U.S. Olympic Committee and accepts it as an absolute necessity that the Olympic family sets itself for a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the statement of the USOC that the interests of our athletes and clubs and their sports are better served if we drive meaningful changes within our organization instead of a decertification.

USA Gymnastics and the USOC have the same goal - to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible for athletes, so that they can follow their dreams in a safe, positive and self-determined environment.

This confirms not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widely accepted, but also provides details that fossils in general do not provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this bird on the upper side was chestnut-brown and on the lower side light- or carotinoid-colored.
The find also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, which is called the rachis, but other features of feathers – hooks and barbules – led the researchers to conclude that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suspected that the sample, although it was the tail of a young dinosaur, showed the plumage of an adult and not the down of a hatchling.
The researchers claimed that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample does not show the feathers of an adult and not the down of a hatchling.

You have found out that the sun works on the basis of the same principles as other stars: It was found that the activity of all stars in the system is driven by their luminosity, rotation and nothing else.
To determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma current, the luminosity and the rotation are taken into account together.
Je kleiner die Rossby-Zahl ist, umso weniger aktiv ist der Stern in Bezug auf Umpolungen des Magnetfelds.

The 802.11n-Standard runs on the frequencies 2,4 Ghz and 5,0 Ghz.
How can he be downward compatible with 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g, provided that the base station has dual-radio?
The speed of 802.11 n is significantly faster than that of the predecessors, which had a maximum theoretical throughput of 600 Mbit/s.
Duvall, married and two grown children, made no great impression on Miller, to whom the story was told.
