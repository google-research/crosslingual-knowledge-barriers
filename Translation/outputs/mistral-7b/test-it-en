The study is still in its initial phase, as cautiously declared by Dr. Ehud Ur, a professor of medicine at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and director of the clinical and scientific department of the Canadian Diabetes Association.
Like other experts, he is skeptical about the possibility of curing diabetes, highlighting that these results do not have relevance for those who are already affected by type 1 diabetes.

A cocktail of antibodies, ZMapp, initially appeared promising on the field, but formal studies have revealed an inferior efficacy compared to that expected in the prevention of deaths.

The USA Gymnastics supports the letter of the U.S. Olympic Committee and recognizes the absolute need of the Olympic community to work to create a safe environment for all its athletes.
We agree with what the USOC has stated, that is, that the interests of our athletes and our clubs, and their sport, can be better served by pursuing a significant change within our organization, and not with decertification.
USA Gymnastics has commissioned an independent investigation to determine how an abuse of the magnitude described with such courage by those who have survived Larry Nassar was able to remain hidden for so long, and is prepared to implement any necessary or appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC have the same goal: to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible, so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a reliable, positive and responsible environment.

This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely disseminated, but provides more details than the fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
. According to what scientists say, the plumage of this animal was marrone castano in the upper part, with a pallida or carotenoide coloration in the lower part.
The discovery also allows to obtain detailed information about the evolution of bird feathers.
Because the plumage of the dinosaur is not equipped with the basic structure, the so-called rachis, but has instead other typical characteristics of feathers, barbs and barbules, the researchers have concluded that the rachis is probably the result of a subsequent evolutionary development of these characteristics.
The structure of the plumage suggests that it was not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or courtship. The researchers hypothesize that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows an adult plumage and not the down of a chick.
According to the researchers' hypotheses, although the tail belongs to a young dinosaur, the specimen reveals the plumage of an adult and not that of a chick.
An autobomb exploded yesterday morning in the police headquarters of Gaziantep, in Turkey, killing two agents and injuring more than twenty people.

They have discovered that the functioning of the Sun is based on the same basic principles as those of other stars: the activity of all the stars in the solar system is determined by nothing other than their luminosity and rotation.
The luminosity is used together with the rotation to define the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flow.
The lower the number of Rossby, the lower is the activity of the star compared to the magnetic inversions.

The 802.11n standard can operate both in the 2.4Ghz band and in the 5.0Ghz band.
Since the base station has dual radios, this will allow it to be backwards compatible with 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g.
The speeds of 802.11n are significantly higher than those of the previous versions, with a maximum theoretical throughput of 600 Mbps.

"We will strive to cut emissions of carbon dioxide per unit of GDP by a significant margin by 2020, compared to 2005 levels", said Hu.
He has not set a precise value for the reduction, saying that it will depend on Chinese economic productivity.
He has invited the developing countries to "avoid the old road of polluting first and cleaning up later".
He also added that they should not, however, be forced to take on obligations that transcend their development phase, as well as their responsibilities and competencies.
