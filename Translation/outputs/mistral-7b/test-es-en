In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were feathered, a theory already widely accepted, it also offers specific data that fossils generally do not offer, such as their color and their three-dimensional structure.
According to the experts, this animal has a brown plumage in the upper part and a pale or carotenoid tone in the lower part.
Also, the finding allows to understand better the evolution of the feathers of the birds.
Given that the plumage of dinosaurs does not have a well-developed axis, called a rachis, but does present other features of feathers (bristles and barbules), the researchers came to the conclusion that it is likely that the rachis is the result of a later evolutionary development of these other characteristics.
The structure of the plumage suggests that its function was not related to flight, but that they used them to regulate temperature or as an indicator of the same. The researchers argue that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample analyzed presents characteristics of the plumage of an adult and not of a hatchling.
The experts' appraisals were that, even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample illustrates more the plumage of an adult than that of a chick.
