"We now have 4-month-old mice that are not diabetic when they used to be," he added.
Dr. Ehud Ur, professor of medicine at Dalhousie University in Halifax (Nova Scotia) and president of the clinical and scientific division of the Canadian Diabetes Association, warned that the research is still in its early stages.

On Monday, during a radio show on Sveriges Radio in Sweden, Sara Danius, the permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy's Nobel Committee for Literature, publicly announced that the committee, unable to directly reach Bob Dylan regarding the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature, had given up trying to contact him.

Previously, Ring's CEO, Jamie Siminoff, pointed out that he launched the company when the doorbell of his front door was not audible from his shop in his garage.
He says he designed a Wi-Fi doorbell.
Mr. Siminoff stated that sales increased after his appearance in a 2013 episode of Shark Tank where the series panel refused to fund the start-up.
In late 2017, Siminoff appeared on the QVC home shopping network.
Ring also settled a lawsuit with a competing security company, ADT Corporation.
Even if an experimental vaccine seems so far capable of reducing the mortality rate of Ebola, no remedy has yet been sufficiently effective to treat the existing infection.
Even though the administration of an antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially showed promising signs in the field, formal studies have shown that its ability to limit deaths did not meet expectations.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp was used as a control, which means that the scientists used it as a reference point and compared it with the three other treatments.
The American Gymnastics Federation supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and accepts the absolute necessity for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the statement of the USOC (United States Olympic Committee) that the interests of our athletes and our clubs, as well as their sport, could be better served. This can be done by moving forward and making significant changes within our organization, rather than revoking accreditation.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that could shed light on how the abuse of the scale described so bravely by the survivors of Larry Nassar could have gone unnoticed for so long and adopts any necessary and appropriate change.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC have the same goal: to make gymnastics, along with other sports, as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive, and empowering environment.
Throughout the 1960s, Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy as an advisor, then for the administration of Lyndon B. Johnson.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widespread, but also provides details that fossils usually cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown on top and pale or carotenoid in color underneath.
This discovery also allows a better understanding of the evolution of feathers in birds.
Given that dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed shaft, known as a rachis, but nonetheless show other characteristics unique to feathers - barbs and barbules - researchers have deduced that the rachis was probably an evolutionary development subsequent to these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers have suggested that, even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage rather than the down of a chick.
Scientists specify that it is indeed the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, but the sample reveals plumage belonging to an adult individual, not a young one.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty other people.
The governor's office declared that nineteen of the injured were police officers.
The police have stated that they suspect an alleged Daesh (IS) activist as the suspect behind this attack.
They found that the Sun operates according to the same basic principles as other stars. The activity of all the stars in the system is determined by their brightness, their rotation, and nothing else.
Brightness and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to plasma flow.
Regarding magnetic inversions, the smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is.
During his journey, Iwasaki encountered problems on numerous occasions.
He was robbed by pirates, attacked in Tibet by a rabid dog, escaped a marriage in Nepal, and was arrested in India.
The 802.11n standard operates on both 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz frequencies.
This will allow backward compatibility with 802.11a, b and g iterations, provided that the station has two radios.
The speeds of the Wi-Fi 802.11n standard are significantly faster than its predecessors, with a theoretical maximum throughput of 600 Mbit/s.
Duvall, who is married and has two adult children, did not make a good impression on Miller, to whom the story was recounted.
When asked to comment, Miller stated: "Mike talks a lot during the hearing... I was preparing, so I didn't really hear what he was saying".
"We will strive to significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 2020 compared to the 2005 level," said Mr. Hu.
He did not quantify these reductions, saying they will be based on Chinese economic output.
Hu encouraged developing countries "to avoid the old method of polluting first and cleaning up afterwards".
He added that "however, we should not ask them to assume obligations that exceed their stage of development, their responsibility and their capabilities."
