„We now have 4 month old mice that had diabetes and now don’t have it anymore“, he added.
Dr. Ehud Ur, professor of medicine at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and chairman of the clinical and scientific department of the Canadian Diabetes Association, cautioned that the research was still in its infancy.

Jamie Siminoff, CEO of Ring, once said that he founded the company after he couldn't hear his doorbell from his garage workshop.
He said that he had built a WiFi doorbell.
Siminoff said sales were strong after his appearance on “Shark Tank” in 2013, even though the show’s panel of investors had turned down funding for his start-up.
In late 2017, Siminoff appeared on the TV shopping channel QVC.
Ring has also settled a legal dispute with the competing security company ADT Corporation.
While an experimental vaccine appears to be able to reduce Ebola mortality, there are currently no drugs that have been proven to be clearly suitable for the treatment of existing infections.
An antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially showed promise, but formal studies showed that it, in terms of preventing deaths, had fewer benefits than hoped for.
In the PALM study, ZMapp was used as a control, i.e. the scientists used it as a baseline and compared the three other treatments with it.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and accepts it as an absolute necessity that the Olympic family works to create a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC’s statement that the best interests of our athletes and clubs and their sport are served by moving forward with meaningful changes within our organization, rather than pursuing decertification.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that could bring to light how abuse on the scale described so bravely by the survivors of Larry Nassar could have gone undetected for so long, and welcomes all necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC share the same goal - to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible for athletes so they can follow their dreams in a safe, positive and self-determined environment.
During the 1960s, Brzezinski served as an advisor to John F. Kennedy and later to the administration of Lyndon B. Johnson.

The announcement came after a telephone conversation between Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
Turkey would monitor captured ISIS fighters whose repatriation has been rejected by European countries, the statement said.
This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but also provides details that fossils in general cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were chestnut brown on the upper side and light- or carotinoid-colored on the lower side.
The discovery also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, which is called the rachis, but they do have other features of feathers – barbs and barbules – the researchers concluded that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but rather for temperature regulation or for display. The researchers surmised that the specimen, although it is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, shows the feathers of an adult and not the down of a chick.
The researchers claimed that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the feathers of an adult and not down of a chick.
A car bomb exploded this morning in the police headquarters of the Turkish city of Gaziantep, killing two police officers and wounding more than twenty other people.
According to the governor's office, nineteen of the injured are police officers.
Police said they suspect a militant Daesh (ISIL) supporter was behind the attack.
You have discovered that the sun works on the same basic principles as other stars: It has been discovered that the activity of all stars in the system is driven by their luminosity, rotation, and nothing else.
To determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flow, the luminosity and the rotation are taken into account together.
The smaller the Rossby number is, the less active the star is in terms of reversals of the magnetic field.
During the trip Iwasaki got into trouble many times.
He was robbed by pirates, attacked by a rabid dog in Tibet, escaped a wedding in Nepal and was arrested in India.
The 802.11n standard runs on the frequencies 2.4 Ghz and 5.0 Ghz.
This allows it to be backward compatible with 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g, provided the base station has dual radio.
The speed of 802.11 n is much faster than that of its predecessors, which had a maximum theoretical throughput of 600 Mbit/s.
Duvall, married and with two grown children, didn't make much of an impression on Miller, who was told the story.
"When asked for a comment, Miller said: ""Mike speaks a lot during the hearing... I prepared myself and could therefore not really hear what he said."""
“We will strive to reduce carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 2020 significantly below the 2005 level,” Hu said.
He did not give a figure for the cuts, but said they would be based on China's economic performance.
He encouraged developing countries to avoid the old path of first polluting and then cleaning up.
He added that “they should not, however, be called upon to enter into commitments that go beyond their level of development, their responsibility and their capabilities”.
