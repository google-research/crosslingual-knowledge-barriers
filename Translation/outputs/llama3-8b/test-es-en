In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were feathered, a theory already widespread, it also offers specific data that fossils generally do not offer, such as their color and their three-dimensional structure.
According to experts, this animal has a brown plumage on the upper part and a pale or carotenoid tone on the lower part.
In addition, the discovery allows us to better understand the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the plumage of dinosaurs does not have a well-developed axis, called the rachis, but does have other features of feathers (hairs and barbules), researchers came to the conclusion that it is likely that the rachis is the result of a later evolutionary development of these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that its function was not related to flight, but that they used them to regulate temperature or as an indicator of the same. The researchers maintain that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample analyzed presents features of the plumage of an adult and not of a chick.
The experts' appraisals were that, even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen illustrates more the plumage of an adult than that of a chick.
