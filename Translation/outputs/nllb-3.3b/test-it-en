"We have four-month-old babies who were diabetic before and are not diabetic anymore", she added.
The study is still in its early stages, as cautioned by Dr. Ehud Ur, professor of medicine at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and director of the clinical and scientific department of the Canadian Diabetes Association.
Like other experts, he is sceptical about the possibility of curing diabetes, stressing that these findings are not relevant to people already suffering from type 1 diabetes.
The Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy's Nobel Committee for Literature, Sara Danius, announced publicly during a radio program aired on Monday on Swedish radio Sveriges Radio that the Committee had renounced contacting Bob Dylan, unable to reach him directly to inform him of the 2016 Nobel Prize for Literature.

Earlier, Jamie Siminoff, Ring's CEO, had pointed out that the company was born when you still couldn't hear the bell from your shop in the garage.
He said he built a Wi-Fi bell.

Siminoff is featured on the commercial television station QVC until the end of 2017.
Ring has also reached a transaction agreement with the competing security services company, ADT Corporation.
While there appears to be an experimental vaccine that can reduce mortality from Ebola, no drug has yet been found that has been clearly demonstrated to be suitable for the treatment of the existing infection.
A cocktail of antibodies, ZMapp, was initially shown to be promising in the field, but formal studies have revealed a lower than expected efficacy in preventing deaths.
In the PALM study, ZMapp was used as a control, whereas the scientists used it as a reference and compared it to the other three therapies.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and recognizes the absolute need on the part of the Olympic community to work towards creating a safe environment for all of its athletes.
We agree with the USOC that the interests of our athletes and our clubs, and of their sport, can be best served by bringing about a significant change within our organisation, and not by decertification.
USA Gymnastics has sponsored an independent investigation to understand how it was possible that an abuse of the dimensions described with such courage by those who managed to survive Larry Nassar remained hidden for so long, and is willing to implement any necessary or appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC share the same objective: to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible, so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a trustworthy, positive and responsible environment.

This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a widely held theory, but also provides more detail than fossils, such as colour and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was brownish-brown in the upper part, with a pale or carotenoid coloration in the lower part.
The discovery also provides detailed information on the evolution of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur plumage lacks the basic structure, called the tail, but instead has other features typical of feathers, beards, and barbels, researchers have concluded that the tail is likely the result of a successive evolutionary development of these characteristics.
The structure of the plumage suggests that it was not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or courtship.
According to the hypothesis of the researchers, despite the coda belonging to a young dinosaur, the specimen reveals a plumage of an adult specimen and not that of a chick.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two officers and injuring more than 20 people.
The governor's office has reported that 19 of the injured were police officers.

They discovered that the Sun's motion is based on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the solar system is determined by nothing more than their luminosity and rotation.
Luminosity is used in conjunction with rotation to define the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the flow of plasma.
The lower the Rossby number, the less the star's activity relative to magnetic inversions.

The 802.11n standard can operate in both the 2.4GHz and the 5.0GHz bands.
Since the base station has a dual radio, this will allow it to be backward compatible with 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g.
The speeds of 802.11n are considerably higher than those of the previous versions, with a maximum theoretical throughput of 600 Mbps.
Duvall, married with two adult children, has not shown a great interest in Miller, and has told him the story.

"We will strive to cut carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by a considerable margin by 2020, compared to 2005 levels", said Hu.
No precise value of the reduction has been established, stating that it will depend on Chinese economic productivity.
He called on developing countries to "avoid the old path of polluting first and then repulsing".
He also added that they should not, however, be forced to assume obligations which transcend their stage of development, such as their responsibility and competence.
