"Currently, we have four-month-old mice that used to be diabetic and are no longer so", he added.
The research is still in its early stages, as indicated by Dr. Ehud Ur, a professor in the medical school of Dalhousie University, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and director of the clinical and scientific department of the Canadian Diabetes Association.
Like other specialists, he is skeptical about whether diabetes is curable and notes that these findings are not relevant to those who already suffer from type 1 diabetes.
On Monday, Sara Danius, permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy's Nobel Committee for Literature, publicly stated on a radio program in Sweden that, unable to contact Bob Dylan directly to communicate with him about the 2016 Literature Prize, the committee had abandoned its efforts to communicate with him.

Earlier, Ring's CEO, Jamie Siminoff, mentioned that the company had initiated the process because the doorbell could not be heard from the tent he had set up in his garage.
He said he built a timbre wifi.
Siminoff stated that sales skyrocketed after his appearance in an episode of Shark Tank in 2013, and that the television program's panel refused to fund the company's launch.
Towards the end of 2017, Siminoff made an appearance on the QVC television shopping channel.
Ring also reached a settlement in the litigation with the competing security company, ADT Corporation.
To date, no drug has been scientifically proven to be effective in treating the existing Ebola infection, although an experimental vaccine appears to be able to reduce mortality from the disease.
Zmapp, a combination of antibodies, had a promising field result initially, but formal studies demonstrated that it was less beneficial than expected in preventing death.
In the PALM trial, the function of Zmapp was control, i.e., the scientists used it as a basis and compared it to the other three treatments.
USA Gymnastics supports the United States Olympic Committee's note and recognizes that it is imperative that the Olympic family foster a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We concur with the USOC's declaration that the interests of athletes, clubs and their sports can be served more appropriately if progress is made with significant changes within our organization, rather than with the withdrawal of the certifications.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that may clarify how the abuse of proportion described by survivors of Larry Nassa with such courage may have gone unnoticed for so long and accepted any necessary and appropriate change.
The goal of USA Gymnastics and USOC is the same: to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible for athletes to pursue their dreams in a protected, positive and empowered environment.
During the 1960s, Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy in an advisory capacity and, later, for the government of Lyndon B. Johnson.

Turkey would also take over the surveillance of captured ISIS militants, whose repatriation was denied by the European nations, according to the communiqué.
In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were feathered, a now generalized theory also offers specific data that fossils generally do not offer, such as their color and three-dimensional structure.
According to experts, this animal has a chestnut plumage in the upper part and a pale or carotenoid hue in the lower part.
The find also allows for a better understanding of the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the feathers of dinosaurs do not have a well-developed tail, called the rachis, but do have other features of feathers (cerdas and barbulas), researchers concluded that it is likely that the rachis was the result of a later evolutionary development of these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that their function was not related to flight, but rather was used to regulate temperature or as an indicator of it. The researchers argue that although it is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen analyzed exhibits features of adult feathers rather than that of a pollen.
Experts' assessments were that, even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen illustrates the plumage of an adult more than that of a pollen.
In the morning yesterday, in Gaziantep, Turkey, a car bomb killed two police officers and injured more than twenty other people.
The government said that 19 of the injured were police.
The police reported that the suspect for the attack is a suspected militant of Daish (ELIL).
It was discovered that the Sun was governed by the same basic principles as other stars: the only factors that drove its activity within the system were its luminosity and its rotation.
The intensity of the light and the rotation are combined to calculate the Rossby number of a star, linked to the plasma flux.
The lower the Rossby number, the lower the activity of the star in relation to its magnetic inversions.
Iwasaki had to face numerous problems during his journey.
He was attacked by pirates, bitten by a rabid dog in Tibet, escaped from marriage in Nepal and was detained by the police in India.
The 802.11n standard operates on both 2.4Ghz and 5.0Ghz frequencies.
This will make it possible to be compatible with earlier versions of 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g, provided that the base station has dual radios.
The speeds of the 802.11n standard are much higher than those achieved by its predecessors, with a theoretical maximum throughput of 600 Mbps.
Duvall, who is married and has two grown children, did not make a good impression on Miller, who was the one who told him the story.
Asked for a comment, Miller said: "Mike speaks a lot during the hearing... I was preparing, so I really couldn't hear what he was saying".
"We will work hard to reduce the level of carbon dioxide emitted per unit of GDP by the year 2020, so that the difference is significant compared to 2005", Hu said.
No mention was made of a figure for the cuts and it was stated that they would be made on the basis of China's economic output.
He encouraged developing states not to return to the traditional path of polluting first and cleaning up afterwards.
Agregó: "It is not correct, however, to require them to assume obligations that exceed their developmental stage, level of responsibility and capabilities".
