The antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially proved to be more promising, but formal studies showed that it brought less benefit than expected in terms of preventing deaths.

USA Gymnastics supports the brief of the United States Olympic Committees and accepts it as an absolute necessity that the Olympic family establishes a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC that the interests of our athletes and clubs and their sport are best served by bringing about meaningful change within our organization rather than by desertification.
USA Gymnastics supported an independent investigation, which could bring to light the extent of the abuse described by the survivors of Lary Nassar, which could remain undetected for so long, and that all necessary and appropriate changes are welcome.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC have the same goal - to make the sport of gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible for athletes, so that they can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive and self-determined environment.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widely accepted, but also provides details that fossils in general cannot provide, such as colour and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal are chestnut brown on the upper side and dark brown on the under side.
The Fund also grants an insight into the evolution of feathers at the birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have well-developed scaffolds, the name "rachis" is used, but other features of feathers - such as wider hooks and barbels - have led researchers to conclude that the "rachis" was probably a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but rather for temperature regulation or for hunting. The researchers hypothesize that the specimen, although the tail of a young dinosaur, shows the feathers of an adult and not the down of a chicken.
The researchers claim that although the tail of a young dinosaur is dead, the feathers of an adult and no tail are visible.

They have found that the Sun works on the same basic principles as all other stars: It has been found that the activity of all stars in the solar system is driven by their luminosity, rotation, and nothing else.
The Rossby-Zahl of a star to determine which is associated with the plasma current, the luminosity and rotation are taken into account.
The smaller the Rossby-Zahl is, the less active the star is in relation to the magnetic field.

The 802.11n standard runs on the 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz frequencies.
The basic station is therefore compatible with 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g provided it has dual radio.
The speed of 802.11 n is substantially faster than its predecessors, which had a maximum theoretical throughput of 600 Mbit/s.
Duvall, married and with two grown children, has not made a great impression on Miller, to whom the story has been told.

The Commission has also proposed that the European Union should be given the task of developing a common policy on the environment.
He added that they should not, however, be required to undertake commitments which go beyond their developmental stage, responsibilities and abilities.
