 We have at present 4-month-old mice that are not diabetic, although they were diabetic before, he added.
Dr. Ehud Ur, professor of medicine at Dalhousie University in Halifax (New Scotland) and president of the clinical and scientific division of the Canadian Diabetes Association, warned that the research was still in its infancy.
Like other experts, he is sceptical about the possibility of curing diabetes, noting that these results are not applicable to people who already suffer from type 1 diabetes.
On Monday, during a radio broadcast on Sveriges Radio, in Sweden, Sara Danius, permanent secretary of the Nobel Committee for Literature of the Swedish Academy, announced publicly that the committee, unable to directly contact Bob Dylan about the Nobel Prize for Literature 2016, had renounced contacting him.

Previously, the CEO of Ring, Jamie Siminoff, had remarked that he had launched the company when the doorbell was not audible from his warehouse in his garage.
He said he designed a sonnette de porte Wi-Fi.
Mr. Siminoff stated that sales increased after his appearance in 2013 in an episode of Shark Tank where the panel of the series refused to fund the start-up.
In late 2017, Siminoff appeared on the QVC television shopping channel.
Ring also settled a lawsuit with a competing security firm, l'ADT Corporation.
Even though an experimental vaccine appears to be able to reduce the mortality rate of Ebola, no cure has yet been sufficiently effective to treat the existing infection.
Although administration of a cocktail of antibodies, ZMapp, initially showed promising signs in the field, formal studies have demonstrated that its ability to limit deaths did not meet expectations.
In the PALM trial, the ZMapp served as a de témoin, meaning that the scientists used it as a reference and compared the three other treatments.
The American Gymnastics Federation supports the letter of the United States Olympic Committee and accepts the absolute necessity of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, could be better served by moving forward and making significant changes within our organisation rather than revoking accreditation.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that could shed light on the way in which the abuse of proportion so courageously described by the survivors of Larry Nassar could go unnoticed for so long and adopt any change necessary and appropriate.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC have the same objective: to make gymnastics, as well as other sports, as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive and responsible environment.
Throughout the 1960s, Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy as a counselor, then for the administration of Lyndon B. Johnson.
During the 1976 elections, he was Carter's foreign policy adviser, then was National Security Adviser (NSA) from 1977 to 1981, succeeding Henry Kissinger.

The announcement was made after Mr. Trump had a telephone conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
Turkey would also take charge of the guard of captured ISIS fighters who, according to the declaration, European nations have refused to repatriate.
This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely held, but provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional disposition.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was brownish-châtain on the upper side and pale or carotenoid on the underside.
This discovery also allows for a better understanding of the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have an entirely developed stem, called a rachis, but do show other feather-like characteristics - barbs and barbels - researchers have concluded that the rachis was probably an evolutionary development later than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that, even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows an adult plumage and not the duvet of a young one.
The scientists say that it is certainly the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, but the specimen reveals a plumage belonging to an adult individual, and not to a juvenile.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty other people.
The governor's office said 19 of the injured were police officers.
The police declared a suspected militant of Daesh (ÉI) as the suspect at the origin of this attack.
They found that the Sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars, and that the activity of all the stars in the system is determined by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
The luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flux.
As for the magnetic inversions, plus the Rossby number is petit, moins l'étoile is active.
During his voyage, Iwasaki encountered problems on numerous occasions.
He was robbed by pirates, attacked in Tibet by an enraged dog, escaped from a marriage in Nepal and was arrested in India.
The 802.11n standard operates on both the 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz frequencies.
This will allow backward compatibility with the 802.11a, b and g iterations, provided that the station has two radios.
The Wi-Fi 802.11n standard is significantly faster than its predecessors, with a theoretical maximum speed of 600 Mbit/s.
Duvall, who is married and has two adult children, did not make a good impression on Miller, to whom the story was related.
When asked to comment, Miller said: "Mike speaks a lot during the hearing... I was preparing, so I didn't really hear what he said".
 We will endeavour to reduce carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP significantly by 2020 compared to 2005 levels, declared Mr Hu.
He did not quantify these reductions, saying they would be based on Chinese economic production.
He encouraged developing countries to avoid the old method of 'polluting first and cleaning second'.
He added that they should not, however, be asked to assume obligations which exceed their stage of development, responsibility and capacity.
