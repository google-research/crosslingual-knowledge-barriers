In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were feathered, a theory already widespread, it also offers specific data that fossils generally do not offer, such as their color and three-dimensional structure.
According to specialists, this animal has chestnut-colored plumage on the upper part and a pale or carotenoid tone on the lower part.
Likewise, the discovery allows us to better understand the evolution of bird feathers.
Since dinosaur plumage does not have a well-developed shaft, called the rachis, but does have other feather features (bristles and barbules), the researchers concluded that the rachis is likely the result of a developmental subsequent evolutionary development of these other characteristics.
The structure of the plumage suggests that their function was not related to flight, but rather that they were used to regulate temperature or as an indicator of it. The researchers maintain that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample analyzed shows features of the plumage of an adult and not a chick.
The experts' assessments were that, even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample illustrates the plumage of an adult more than that of a chick.

Although it was an eminently theoretical work, the program was written with the purpose of simulating the observations made to the Sagittarius galaxy.
It would be the tidal forces between the dark matter present in the galaxy and that of the Milky Way that would cause the effect expected by the group of scientists.
The Milky Way influences the Sagittarius galaxy in the same way that the moon exerts a force of attraction on our planet and causes tides.
The experts concluded that dark matter affects each other just as regular matter does.
This theory maintains that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is located around it in a type of halo and is made up of numerous small particles.
