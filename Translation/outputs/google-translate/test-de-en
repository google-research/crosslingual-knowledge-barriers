At the end of 2017, Siminoff appeared on the teleshopping channel QVC.
Ring also settled a lawsuit with rival security firm ADT Corporation.
While an experimental vaccine appears to be able to reduce Ebola mortality, there are no drugs that have been clearly proven to treat existing infections.
An antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially showed promise, but formal trials showed it had less benefit than hoped in preventing deaths.

USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and accepts it as an absolute imperative that the Olympic family commit to a safe environment for all of our athletes.

Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widely accepted, but it also provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown on the upper side and light or carotenoid colored on the underside.
The find also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft called a rachis, but do have other features of feathers - barbs and barbules - the researchers concluded that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or cardiac protection. The researchers suspected that although the sample was the tail of a young dinosaur, it showed the plumage of an adult and not the down of a chick.
The researchers claimed that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not chick down.
A car bomb detonated yesterday morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and wounding over twenty other people.
According to the governor's office, nineteen of the injured were police officers.
Police said they suspect a Daesh (ISIL) militant was behind the attack.
They discovered that the Sun operates based on the same basic principles as other stars: it was discovered that the activity of all the stars in the system is driven by their luminosity, rotation, and nothing else.
To determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma flow, luminosity and rotation are taken into account together.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of polarity reversals of the magnetic field.

The 802.11n standard runs on the frequencies 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz.
This allows it to be backwards compatible with 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g, provided the base station has dual radio.
The speed of 802.11n is significantly faster than its predecessors, which had a maximum theoretical throughput of 600 Mbit/s.

The work was largely theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon pulls on the Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way also exerts gravitational pull on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The scientists concluded that dark matter acts on other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory suggests that most dark matter is found in a kind of halo around a galaxy and is made up of many small particles.
