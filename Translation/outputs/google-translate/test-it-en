In the PALM study, ZMapp was used as a control, meaning scientists used it as a baseline and compared it to the other three therapies.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and recognizes the imperative need for the Olympic community to work to create a safe environment for all of its athletes.
We agree with what the USOC has said that the interests of our athletes and our clubs, and their sport, can be best served by bringing about meaningful change within our organization, not by decertification.

This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely held, but provides greater detail than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
. According to what scientists say, the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown in the upper part, with a pale or carotenoid color in the lower part.
The discovery also allows us to obtain detailed information about the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the dinosaur's plumage does not have the basic structure, the so-called rachis, but instead has other typical characteristics of feathers, barbs and barbules, the researchers concluded that the rachis is probably the result of an evolutionary development subsequent to these characteristics.
The structure of the plumage suggests that it was not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or courtship. The researchers hypothesize that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the find shows adult plumage and not chick down.
According to the researchers' hypotheses, although the tail belongs to a young dinosaur, the sample reveals the plumage of an adult specimen and not that of a chick.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two officers and wounding over twenty people.

They discovered that the functioning of the Sun is based on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the solar system is determined by nothing other than their brightness and rotation.
Luminosity is used in conjunction with rotation to define a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is with respect to magnetic reversals.

802.11n speeds are considerably faster than previous versions, with a theoretical maximum throughput of 600 Mbps.

The activity carried out was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the surveys carried out of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for had to be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of this galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a force of attraction on the Earth that generates the tides, the Milky Way also exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to deduce that the effects of dark matter on other dark matter are the same effects that "normal" matter has.
This theory holds that much of the dark matter around a galaxy is collected in a kind of halo, made up of a multitude of small particles.
