The USA Gymnastics Federation supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and accepts the absolute necessity of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widely held theory, but provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional layout.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown above and pale or carotenoid colored below.
This discovery also allows us to better understand the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers did not have a fully developed shaft, called a rachis, but did show other features unique to feathers – barbs and barbules – the researchers deduced that the rachis was probably a development subsequent evolution to these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not the down of a chick.
The scientists specify that it is certainly the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, but the sample reveals plumage belonging to an adult individual, and not a young one.

Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
When it comes to magnetic reversals, the smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star.

The work performed was primarily theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a pull on the earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around a galaxy is found in a sort of halo, and is made up of large numbers of small particles.
